Comp20 Course Recap

1. The purpose of this Github repository is to store and save my progress in my pursuits of learning in Web Development. This repository is a collection of projects written using different languages with different end goals, all developed to showcase the breadth and depth of my learning in Comp20.

2. My favorite lab was the final lab (lab 13) because I finally had a chance to explore my interest in computer security and hacking and I feel that I really confirmed that it is a subtopic of computer science about which I am deeply passionate. Hacking into the app was wildly fun and being able to learn about system vulnerabilities has given me great insight as to how attacks take place and how to prevent them. 

3. My confidence in my computer science technical and creative skills has grown immensely from day one until now. I believe that have a wide exposure to various aspects of Web Programming (i.e. HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, NodeJS, etc.) has given me the knowledge of the myriad of elements that make up the diverse and dynamic world of Web Programming. I now feel that I have enough elementary knowledge to go forth and engage in self-learning with these topics, as I plan to create projects in the various languages that we have dabbled in throughout the course.

4. I learned many important things but an important one that I will take away:
a) Never trust user input.
Ex 1: Hacking the web app was fun and surprisingly easy.
Ex 2: The ease at which I hacked the web app was frightening and made me aware of glaring vulnerabilities in other web applications and in computer security in general.

5. I look forward to diving deeper into issues of web and computer security, and creating projects that fuse creativity with hacking.
