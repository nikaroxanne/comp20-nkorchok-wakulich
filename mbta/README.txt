1. Elements correctly implemented: My geolocator is working and renders a marker with, as its icon, a green symbol that I created in the GNU manipulator for this lab. I correctly calculated the Haversine formula for the nearest Red Line Station and outputted that to the infowindow. I rendered a polyline from the geolocation to the nearest Red Line station. 
Elements not correctly implemented: 

2. I used the following websites as guides for writing the Haversine formula, especially to use it to calculate the shortest distance from something. I referenced posts on these forums:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4057665/google-maps-api-v3-find-nearest-markers (this was especially useful since I changed my for loop about five times until I used the method they outlined here.)

I used this website for information on how to pass back object literals from functions: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2917175/return-multiple-values-in-javascript

I used the redline.html file, from the WebProgramming repo on the class Github, as a template for how to approach parsing the JSON data for this problem so I am citing that as a reference.

3. I spent approximately 30 hours on this assignment.
