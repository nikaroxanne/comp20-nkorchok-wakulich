1. Elements correctly implemented: I believe that my function to calculate the Haversine formula works correctly.
Elements not correctly implemented: My geolocator does not work for some reason, though it may be an issue with not loading on my browser.

2. I used the following websites as guides for writing the Haversine formula, especially to use it to calculate the shortest distance from something. I referenced posts on these forums:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4057665/google-maps-api-v3-find-nearest-markers



3. I spent approximately 15 hours on this assignment.
