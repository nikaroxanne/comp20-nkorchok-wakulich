1. Elements correctly implemented: My image for the icon loads.
Elements not correctly implemented: I cannot get the map to load even though I wrote all the JS code for the Polyline, the markers and setting up the initialize function of the map.

2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment. I used the guides, on the W3Schools website and the Google developer website, for information on using the Google Maps API.

3. I spent about 10 hours on this assignment.
