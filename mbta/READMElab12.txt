1. Elements correctly implemented: Server is written in Node.JS and uses Express web app framework, and is deployed on Heroku. Server has one route 'GET/redline.json' which returns JSON string of all Red Line Trains' schedules. CORS is enabled for the app.

Elements not correctly implemented: App runs on local server but not Heroku. I will fix this shortly.

2. I spoke with John about the errors in my code and he was very helpful in explaining the differences between differently scoped variables/parameters which was causing me a lot of confusion and creating the errors. 
I used the following websites for resources:

For information on CORS-enabling 
enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html

For information on Needle:
https://github.com/tomas/needle
https://www.npmjs.com/package/needle

I also referred to our Piazza page when I encountered similar issues as other students did (i.e. app running on local server but not Heroku). Responses on Piazza helped me figure out errors in my own code so I'm citing that as a reference.

3. I spent approximately 3 hours on this assignment.
