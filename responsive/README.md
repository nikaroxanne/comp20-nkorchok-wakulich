1. I correctly implemented the responsive.css file to show one portion of the photo but I am still tweaking the pixel requirements so that the file will yield the correct portion of the image at each given screen width. I don't believe there were any aspects of the work that I did not correctly implement.
2. I didn't collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
3. I spent about 2 hours on this assignment.
