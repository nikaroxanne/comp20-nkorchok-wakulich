Comp20 - lab 6

1. Elements correctly implemented: My stylesheet is correctly implemented and I believe that my code is clear and logically sound.
Elements to be fixed: My subtitles will still not run on the page. I am missing something minor, but key, in my program's structure, and I'm not sure what it is.

2. I didn't collaborate with anyone on this assignment. I asked John (TA) a couple questions about JavaScript objects, which was helpful to clarify specifications for the project's requirements. I used "doublerainbow.html"file from the examples folder in WebProgramming as a template for this assignment since we had to perform almost the exact same task with this lab. I used the same if/else structure for my function to output the lyrics; I reread the doublerainbow files several times to understand how to implement the function for running the subtitles properly.

3. I spent about 4 hours on this assignment.
