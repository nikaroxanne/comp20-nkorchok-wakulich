1. Elements correctly implemented: All elements are correctly implemented. I added lyrics to the video, line by line and added two funny cat photos to the innerHTML.
Elements to be fixed: I fixed all aspects that were causing problems (i.e. changed parameters of addEventListener to take predefined function captions.)

2. I didn't collaborate with anyone on this assignment. I asked John (TA) a couple questions about JavaScript objects, which was helpful to clarify specifications for the project's requirements. I used "doublerainbow.html"file from the examples folder in WebProgramming as a template for this assignment since we had to perform almost the exact same task with this lab. I used the same if/else structure for my function to output the lyrics; I reread the doublerainbow files several times to understand how to implement the function for running the subtitles properly.

3. I spent about 4 hours on this assignment.
