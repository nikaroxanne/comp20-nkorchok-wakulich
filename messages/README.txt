1. Elements correctly implemented: I believe I correctly set the parsed data from the json file to output to the messages div class.
Elements not correctly implemented: I cannot figure out how to parse the file correctly, though I've tried several times. I will keep working until I figure it out.

2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

3. I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
