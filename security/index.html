            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p> This is a security assessment of the web application "server-vuln.js". This security assessment is being carried out for <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/lab-websecurity.html" target="_blank"> Comp 20:Lab 13. </a> </p>
            <p> The application, is a Node.js application that uses Express frameworks and MongoDB. It functions mainly as a database for user check-ins, with its main homepage stating "Not FourSquare." However the vulnerabilities in the code allow for hackers to make malicious hack-ins which threaten the security and the privacy of users of the database as well as the sanctity of the website itself. This document attempts to ratify those errors by explaining the vulnerabilities of the web application and offering solutions for its future. </p>
            <h2>Methodology </h2>
            <p> I began by performing 'black box testing.' Without looking at the source code, I downloaded the files for the application onto my Virtual Machien and configured and ran the application. I then used curl from my terminal to try and hack the web application and thus was able to exploit several security vulnerabilities. I later explored these vulnerabilities as I carried out "white box testing" when I reviewed the source-code in-depth and reviewed ways that security breaches were possible and how to prevent those hacks. </p>
