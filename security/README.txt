1. Elements correctly implemented: Created an html page for the Security and Privacy Assessment of a Web Application. Outlined Introduction of Product (server-vuln.js), Methodology for testing, Abstraction of Findings, Issues Found (with photos and detailed code provided for evidence of problems and resolutions to problems respectively), and Conclusion of Report.
Elements not correctly implemented: All elements are correctly implemented.

2. I asked my friend Brian Cefali some questions about computer security and he elaborated on the different types of attacks (i.e. XSS) which made the core concepts of the lab more clear.

I am citing Gabe Joseph's assignment as a reference since it was helpful in giving me an idea of formatting/structure for this assignment. I also liked what he did with inserting his email in the conclusion and I ended up doing the same thing in my conclusion, so I'm citing him on the originality of that shameless self-promotion.

These are the websites I used for reference:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_NoSQL_injection
http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html#CWE-311

3. I spent approximately 16 hours working on this assignment.
